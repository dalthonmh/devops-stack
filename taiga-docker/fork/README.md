### Start the application

```bash
./launch-taiga.sh
```

After some instants, when the application is started you can proceed to create the superuser with the following script:

```bash
./taiga-manage.sh createsuperuser
```

The taiga-manage.sh script lets launch manage.py commands on the back instance:

```bash
./taiga-manage.sh [COMMAND]
```
